Mental Health App for students

MindPal is an app specially designed for students which is user-friendly and is helpful in relieving stress and improves user's mood. The app is not completely implemented. A demo on how the app functions is given in the link below.

Right after launching the app, students are treated with an uplifting message and then a message of assurance that the app is meant to help them. Users can continue on to the main page.

Here, vital information and different activities are shown and the user can choose to assess or improve their mood, check how close they are to their daily goal or how their performance has been lately in the dashboard. Users can also access their profile which will show their accomplishments and status of their mental health also. 

MoodBooster:
When we click the moodbooster on the main page, the user is given various options to improve their mood with activities like meditation, sleep, exercise and interacting with social media.

When the user chooses meditation, tips to meditate properly and how it can be helpful are presented. A timer can be added to track the meditation time and soothing music playing can be implemented.
When the user chooses exercise, the app gives an encouraging message for the user to exercise and also how helpful it can be. 
When the user chooses the sleep option, the app provides important tips to get a proper sleep. 
Also there is a social media feature which can help users to communicate between each other and also professionals where they can grow a community. Students can relate to memes and other entertainment media which can be used in this section of the app to help them. The social media part is yet to be implemented. 

MoodChecker:
When the user clicks the mood checker option on the main page, they can assess their current mood. To keep things simple there are currently three emotions like happy, sad and angry. We aim to tackle these in a humorous way, so memes are incorporated with each emotion.

When the users choose the happy option, they are assured that their progress is appreciated and they can keep going.
When the users choose the sad option, an uplifting message will pop up and they are assured that they can get better.
When they choose the angry button, a humorous message appears and encourages them to use the moodbooster option we discussed before. 
Later, we can actually study the patterns to evaluate the mental state and effectiveness of the app. But that is yet to be implemented.

Navigation between activities is yet to be done.We were able to implement our ideas till this part and we wish to enhance the functionalities of the app so that many students who are facing difficulties can get help just by clicking on the app which is also created by students. 

Thank you.
